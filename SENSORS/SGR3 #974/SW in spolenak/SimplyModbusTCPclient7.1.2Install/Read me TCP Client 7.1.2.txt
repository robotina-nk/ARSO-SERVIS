GETTING STARTED WITH SIMPLY MODBUS TCP CLIENT 7.1.2

***** Context help is also available by pressing Ctrl-H while in the program *****
*****  Ctrl-H will open a window where information is displayed about items as the cursor hovers over them   *****

See the On-line Manual  ........  http:/www.simplymodbus.ca/TCPmanual.htm

The downloaded zip file, SimplyModbusTCPclient7.1.2Install.zip,  contains:
	setup.exe   
	setup.ini
	data.cab
	install.msi
	InstMsi.exe
	InstMsiW.exe
	Read me TCP Client 7.1.2.txt          - this file
	Read me for Windows 7.txt        - some additional notes about running on Windows 7

1) Unzip the files into the same folder.

2) Run setup.exe to start the Simply Modbus TCP Client 7.1.2 Installation Wizard
    Follow the prompts.  The program will start automatically when the installation is complete.
    Running setup.exe a second time will uninstall the program.

3) If using Windows 7, Activate Windows XP compatibility as shown in the file Read me for Windows 7.txt 

4) From the Start menu, select Programs > Simply Modbus > Simply Modbus TCP Client 7.1.2 to start the program.

5) Enter the IP Connection information: 
      eg.  IP Address = eg. 192.168.1.10 
                       (do not use leading zeroes 192.168.001.010)
           Port settings = 502 

6) Press CONNECT to establish an IP connection with the Server(Modbus Slave).
   When successful, CONNECTED will be shown and the SEND and send continously controls will be enabled.

7) Enter the command information: 
           Mode = TCP or RTU over TCP 
           Slave ID = 1 
           First Register = 40001 
           # Registers = 10
   The Command to be sent will appear in "Request".

8) Press the SEND button.  All bytes received will appear in "Response".
   The response time is shown in 0.1 increments. The response progress bar fills as the the time approached the "fail in" time entered.
   If no answer appears within the "fail in" time, increase the "fail in" time and press SEND again.

9) When a response is received, set the format of the received data.
   check or uncheck 'High byte/Low byte'
   check or uncheck 'Low word/High word'

--- Use Defaults ---

The automatic settings are shown inside the Use Defaults box.
These settings are automatically set to these defaults whenever "First Register" is changed.

First Register   Function Code   Register Size   Offset
00001-10000           1           1 bit coils        1
10001-30000           2           1 bit coils    10001
30001-40000           4           16 bit regs    30001
40001+                3           16 bit regs    40001

Enron exceptions:
32        (events)    3           32 bit regs        0
701-799   (history)   3           32 bit regs        0
1001-1999 (boolean)   1           1 bit coils        0
3001-3999 (short int) 3           16 bit regs        0
5001-5999 (long int)  3           32 bit regs        0
7001-7999 (floats)    3           32 bit regs        0

For Simply Write Modbus:
First Register   Function Code   Register Size   Offset
00001-10000           5(15*)      1 bit coils        1
10001-30000           5(15*)      1 bit coils    10001
30001-40000           6(16*)      16 bit regs    30001
40001+                6(16*)      16 bit regs    40001
 *Function codes 15 and 16 are used when writing multiple values.


The "send continuously" checkbox may be turned on. This will have the effect of repeatedly pressing the SEND button. Increase "pause between sends" in seconds to slow down the rate the requests are sent.

--- Saved Configurations ---
The settings can be saved to text files with the SAVE CFG button and resored with the RESTORE CFG button.

The format of the file is csv (comma separated values).
